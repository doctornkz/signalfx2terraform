package detector

// Indicates how often data is analyzed to determine if an alert should be triggered. This is different from the data display resolution used to populate the detector visualization. The data display resolution is automatically set to the coarsest resolution of all of the publish statements associated with the detector, since they are all displayed together in the same visualization.<br> In the object, the label name of each publish statement in the detector is the property key, and the time is the value. For example, to refer to the label resolution of the publish statement with the label *DetectorStatement*, specify `results[index].labelResolution.DetectorStatement`.
type LabelResolution struct {
	// The alert resolution time for the SignalFlow publish statement labeled with the value `label`.
	Label string `json:"label,omitempty"`
}
