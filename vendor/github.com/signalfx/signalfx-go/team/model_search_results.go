// Query results, in the form of a JSON object
type SearchResults struct {
	// Number of team objects that matched the provided search criteria.<br> **Note:** This value is a count of the total number of objects in the result set. The number of objects that the system returns is affected by the `limit` and `offset` query parameters. In summary:<br>   * `count`: Size of result set   * number of returned objects:        * (`limit` - `offset`) >= `count`: `count`       * (`limit` - `offset`) < `count`: `limit` - `offset`

	// List of team objects that the system returns as the result of the request. The number and location of the objects within the result set depend on the query  parameters you specify in the request.
